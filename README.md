# ðŸ§¬ Research Workbench Command Line Interface

Research Workbench `rwb` is now available for ORIEN partners on Linux, Mac and Windows platforms. Upon the first run, you will be requested to input your ORIEN credentials, which will be cached securely to make future runs easily accessible, unless you explicitly `rwb logout`.


## Installation

Download the executable for your desired platform from [`releases`](https://github.com/AsterInsights/rwb/releases).

### Linux/Mac

```sh
mv rwb.version.arch /a/path/to/bins/on/your/path
chmod +x /a/path/to/bins/on/your/path/rwb
rwb project list
```

#### For example (Linux):

```sh
mv ~/Downloads/rwb.linux.x64 /usr/local/bin/rwb
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rwb
rwb project list
```
